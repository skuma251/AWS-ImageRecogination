**Members' task:-**

Our team collaborated to develop the entire application, with each member contributing to every aspect of it. To efficiently divide our tasks, we first assigned specific areas of the application to each team member to research and develop. For example, Subham focused on developing the web tier, Amarjeet delved into autoscaling, S3 bucket implementation, and the cron script needed to optimize the app tier, and Vinay concentrated on the app tier development. However, we all collaborated and shared our expertise/problems with each other to ensure the successful completion of the entire application.
